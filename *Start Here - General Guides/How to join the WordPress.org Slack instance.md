## Slack とは何ですか？

Slackは、WordPress.orgを作成するチームが使用するオンラインのコラボレーションコミュニケーションツールです。 WebブラウザまたはSlackアプリからアクセスできます。 参加は無料です。

開始するために必要なすべての情報は次のとおりです。

## How do I join?

Create a WordPress Slack account:
1. Visit make.wordpress.org/chat/
2. Log in using your WordPress.org account details. If you don't yet have WordPress.org account, create a one following [this guide](https://github.com/WordPress/contributor-day-handbook/blob/master/*Start%20Here%20-%20General%20Guides/How%20to%20get%20a%20WordPress.org%20account.md).
3. After logging in, scroll to “Join the WordPress team on Slack” and enter either your email address or choose the option ‘I understand, please send me an invite.’ :

Note: we recommend that you use the same username for Slack as you use for WordPress.org, though it is possible to use a different one.

The email address associated with your Slack username will be: [wporgusername]@chat.wordpress.org. Make a note of this as it will be important if you forget your password.

4. Check your inbox for an invitation link to Slack. Click ‘Join Now’ in the email and fill in your First Name (the name that will be displayed - this can also be changed later) and enter a Password:

6. (Optional) Click on ‘Channels’ in the navigation column on the left. Find the team channel you want to join and click on the name to enter it (for instance, the documentation team and can be found in the #docs channel)
7. It can be helpful to update your Slack profile by adding some details about your WordPress interests and timezone to help team members welcome and connect with you. To do this:
* Click on your name in the top left corner of the Slack screen
* Choose ‘Profile and Account’
* Choose ‘Edit Profile’
* Upload a photo to help people recognize you. 
8. Welcome to the WordPress.org community on Slack.

## Staying connected on Slack
You can set your status under ‘Profile’ so others know if you are available.

Slack notifications keep you informed about messages that might be of interest to you. By default, you will receive notifications when you receive a direct message, when someone @-mentions you in a channel, or when someone @-mentions a channel you are in.   

You can edit which notifications you receive by changing your preferences. To do this, click on the name of the Slack instance in the top left corner of the page and click on ‘Preferences’:
