# How to set up your profile picture: Gravatar

Gravatar (which stands for Globally Recognized Avatar) is a free service provided by Automattic. It allows you to assign a picture to your email account so that every time you use that email account in one of the connected services, your profile picture will be shown.

If you already have a WordPress.com account, you can use this to sign into gravatar.com. To add your profile picture, navigate to ‘Add pictures and emails’.

If you do not have a WordPress.com account already, follow the below steps to sign up for a Gravatar account.

## Sign up for an account

1.  Go to [https://gravatar.com/](https://gravatar.com/)
    
2.  Click on the blue button ‘Create Your Own Gravatar’ and enter your details: Email address, Username, Password. Then click ‘Create Your Account’ to save your details.

3.  You will receive an email asking you to confirm your email address. The email will come from WordPress.com, not Gravatar. Please note that you won't be able to use Gravatar until you click on the link in that email.
    
4.  Click on the ‘Activate Account’ button in the email to finish the process.
    
5.  You will then be taken back to WordPress.com where you'll see a message thanking you for confirming your email and asking if you want to return to gravatar.com.
    
6.  Click the ‘Sign In to Gravatar’ button to do just that.
    

## Add your email accounts

You can add your Gravatar profile picture to as many email addresses as you like. To do this, sign into gravatar.com. Then on the home page, under your pictures, click on ‘Add email address’.

Every time you add an email address you will have to confirm it via the email you receive from WordPress.com.

You can return to the home page at any time by clicking on ‘My Gravatars’ on the black horizontal toolbar on the top of the screen.

4.  Select the source of your image. You can upload an image from your computer, enter a URL if your image is hosted elsewhere online, select an image you have previously uploaded or use your webcam to take a new photo. Click ‘Next’ to continue.
    
5.  Once you have added your image, you will have the option to resize the picture and see the results in different sizes. Even if you do not want to change anything, you will need to click ‘Crop Image’ to move to the next step.
    
6.  Choose a rating for your image. If your gravatar might not be suitable for younger or sensitive audiences, make sure to set a rating higher than G.
    
7.  You will then be asked ‘Where would you like to use this image?’. This is where you connect your picture to your email account(s). You can select more than one address. Click ‘Use for selected addresses’ to confirm.
   
    If you want to change the picture associated with an email account, you will need to click on the email account, click on the picture and confirm you want to link them.
